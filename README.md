# Practice Session Tracker - A Java Learning Project

A hands-on Java learning project built using some learning principles from [The Math Academy Way](https://www.justinmath.com/files/the-math-academy-way.pdf). This is NOT a production application. It's simply an experiment using AI (Claude Code) to help develop a deliberate practice environment designed to build an understanding of Java fundamentals.
